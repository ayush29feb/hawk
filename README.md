# Hawk

Say hello to Hawk, a parental monitoring app that allows you to easily check-in on your teen driver. With our iPhone app, parents can quickly track the history of their car's driving usage and set custom alerts if someone speeds, turns on the car in the middle of the night or leaves a certain radius of your home unexpectedly.
